_Differential privacy has become the standard for protecting the privacy of individuals with formal guarantees of plausible deniability. This thesis proposes new techniques for language-based analysis of differential privacy of programs in a variety of contexts spanning static and dynamic analysis.

Our approach towards differential privacy analysis makes use of ideas from linear type systems and static/dynamic taint analysis.

While several prior approaches towards differential privacy analysis exist, this thesis proposes techniques which are designed to, in several regards, be more flexible and usable than prior work._
