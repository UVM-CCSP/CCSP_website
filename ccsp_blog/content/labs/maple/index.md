The Methods and Programming Languages for Experimentation (MaPLE) lab focuses on applying techniques from formal methods and programming languages to experimental design. We are a _methodology_ lab and our research focuses on questions of _how_ we know whether researchers and the general public can trust research results. Within the CCSP, we focus on formal experimental methodologies within security and privacy contexts.
