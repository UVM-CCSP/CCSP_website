### Cybersecurity Certificate ### 

The demand for cybersecurity skills is growing in government, private companies and other organizations such as universities and non-profits. It is critical for organizational leaders and managers, as well as IT professionals, to be prepared to anticipate the wide-ranging impacts of a cybersecurity breach, understand how to mitigate them, and learn to prevent them in the future.
This certificate is designed to develop a comprehensive foundation in the knowledge and skills necessary to pursue a career in cybersecurity. Whether you are new to computer science, or are interested in adding cybersecurity to your undergraduate degree, this is a highly desirable credential.

Courses are offered online and the certificate includes a deliberate selection of foundational computer science courses, including programming, web, and database development, as well as cybersecurity coursework covering both the technical and conceptual aspects of cybersecurity. A reliable computer is essential in order to complete the coursework.

Required:
CS 008: Introduction to Web Development
CS 021: Computer Programming I
CS 166 Cybersecurity Principles OR CS 266 Network Security and Cryptography

Plus two additional approved cybersecurity courses. Existing approved cybersecurity electives are listed below (this list may change as offerings are updated):
CIS 001: Cybersecurity Law and Policy
CS 006: Exploring Cybersecurity
CS 166: Cybersecurity Principles
CS 167: Cybersecurity Defense
CS 266: Network Security and Cryptography
CS 225: Programming Languages
CS 265: Computer Networks

Our general requirements and guidelines for students advancing through our Certificate in Computer Software: Cybersecurity program can be found here: https://learn.uvm.edu/program/certificate-in-computer-software/ (See “Cybersecurity”).

### Course Highlights ###
CS 006. Exploring Cybersecurity. 3 Credits. 
Fundamental concepts and tools utilized by cybersecurity professionals to assess and detect software and network vulnerabilities; best practices in physical and data security through the use of appropriate risk management methodologies. No credit if taken after CS 166 or 266.

CIS 001. Cybersecurity: Law & Policy. 3 Credits. 
In today’s cybersecurity environment, high cyber technical competence alone is not enough to make cybersecurity operators the most valuable assets to their organizations that they could be. To reach their full potential, they need to be able to use these skills with an understanding of the requirements and constraints that cybersecurity laws and regulations place on cyber defense, the evolving impacts of national and international policies in creating a more secure cybersecurity environment, and how to effectively interact with organizational leadership to properly orient their organizations to deal with cybersecurity issues. This course is composed of three modules: Law, Policy, and Organizational Change.

CS 166. Cybersecurity Principles. 3 Credits.
Introduction to cybersecurity, fundamental security design principles, programming flaws, malicious code, web and database security, cryptography algorithms and hashing functions; overview of computer networks and common network threat vectors. No credit if taken after CS 266. Prerequisites: CS 008, CS 021.

CS 167. Cybersecurity Defense. 3 Credits.
Cyber defense policy, privacy, ethics; network threat defense, intrusion detection systems, intro to penetration testing, OS security principles, system/network admin, cloud, mobile and IoT security; overview of security planning, management and incident response. No credit if taken after CS 266. Prerequisite: CS 166.

MATH 259. Cryptography. 3 Credits.
A survey of classical and modern cryptography. The strengths and weaknesses of various cryptosystems are discussed. Topics include specific public-key and private-key cryptosystems such as RSA, ElGamal, and elliptic curve cryptosystems, as well as digital signatures and key exchange. Prerequisite: MATH 052 or CS 064; any 100-level MATH course. 

CS 266. Network Security & Cryptography. 3 Credits.
Security and secrecy in a networked environment. Cryptography: public and private key. Authentication: trusted agents, tickets. Electronic mail and digital signatures. Privacy and national security. Prerequisite: CS 124.

CS 295. Software Verification. 3 Credits.
Advanced methods for software verification. Software verification can mean many things—from “lightweight” verification, such as verifying the absence of simple type errors, to “middleweight” verification, such as verifying the absence of buffer overflows or runtime exceptions, to “heavyweight” verification, such as verifying the full functional correctness of a C compiler. We will study this entire spectrum of verification, with a sharper focus on the following topics: (1) specification design, both deep and shallow; (2) automation and semi-automation techniques in verification; and (3) correct-by-construction software design. We will explore verification topics through a tool called a proof assistant. Proof assistants allow the embedding of programs within the tool, as well as constructing proofs of correctness about the embedded programs. The default mode of verification for the tool is manual and interactive, however full automation of correctness proofs can also be achieved. After constructing the proof of correctness for a piece of software, one then “extracts” an executable, certified program from the tool environment. It is also possible to mix computation and logical fragments of the tool, which can lead to a more correct-by-construction process for certified software design. Prerequisite: CS 124, CS 125.

CS 295. Data Privacy. 3 Credits.
How can we learn from sensitive data collected from individuals, while protecting the privacy of those individuals? This question is central to the study of data privacy, and is increasingly relevant with the widespread collection of our personal data. Analysis of this data can lead to important benefits for society, including advances in medicine and public infrastructure, but can also result in privacy breaches that expose our most closely-held secrets. This course will explore both threats to privacy and solutions to the data privacy problem. We will demonstrate that traditional approaches to protecting privacy, such as anonymization, are subject to powerful attacks that reveal individuals’ sensitive data. We will see that while more recent approaches for protecting privacy, including k-anonymity and l-diversity, are more resistant to these attacks, they are not immune. Then, we will explore recent formal notions of privacy, including differential privacy. Differential privacy provides a rigorous formal definition of individual privacy that enables a wide range of statistical analyses while protecting privacy. We will explore a number of differentially private algorithms for analytics and machine learning, and learn about the algorithmic building blocks and proof techniques used to develop them. In addition to learning about the mathematical foundations of differential privacy, we will explore its practical implications. We will learn about existing practical systems for enforcing differential privacy and examine the challenges of building such systems. This course will include programming assignments and an end-of-semester project, in which students are expected to demonstrate both mastery of the concepts we explore and understanding of their practical implications by building their own systems that perform privacy-preserving analyses on real data. Prerequisite: CS 124, CS 125.

CS 295. Computer Security Foundations. 3 Credits.
Mathematical foundations of computer security, with a focus on programming languages and logics for expressing and enforcing security, especially in distributed software systems. Topics covered include programming language-based security issues such as information flow, Java stack inspection, authorization logics, and semantic properties such as type safety, noninterference, and other properties and hyperproperties. Why would you take this course? It will appeal to you if (1) you are interested in Computer Security in software systems-- the topics we study are relevant to defenses against language-level vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow, XSS, and code injection, as well as protection of secure data in information systems. (2) OR if you are interested in programming languages, mathematical logic, and theory of computer science. (3) OR if you are interested in areas of CS where theory meets practice, and scientific approaches to problems relevant to CS. Prerequisite: Students should have a fundamental background in CS theory. Prerequisites are CS124, CS125, with CS225 a recommended pre- or co-requisite.
