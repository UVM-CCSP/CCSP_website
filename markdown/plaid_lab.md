### Industry Partnerships ###

#### *Provable Fairness in Deep Learning* ####
Artificial intelligence is a powerful tool, but AI systems often
reflect and magnify society's biases -- for example, by predicting
above-average risk of recidivism for Black defendants. This project
seeks to *prove* that a model's predictions are free of this kind of
bias. We seek to apply techniques from program analysis to analyze a
machine learning model directly, enabling a proof that the model's
predictions satisfy a formal fairness guarantee.

### Funded Projects ###

#### *Local Sensitivity for Differentially Private Deep Learning* ####

Differential privacy can provide strong privacy guarantees for deep
learning models, but existing approaches require adding too much noise
to train accurate models. This project aims to use techniques from
program analysis to bound the *local sensitivity* of model updates, in
order to significantly reduce the amount of noise needed during
training and increase the accuracy of the trained models.

*UVM PIs: Joe Near. Key Personnel: David Darais. Funded by DARPA (CSL).*

#### *Compilers for Zero-knowledge Proofs* ####

Zero-knowledge proofs are a family of cryptographic approaches used to convince
another party that some secret or evidence is known, without directly revealing
the evidence. This framework has the potential to secure and/or enable
important societal functions, such as auctions, voting and auditing.  However,
the computation and resource cost of realizing the framework has been
cost-prohibitive to adoption in practice for non-trivial applications. In this
project, we aim to improve the performance of zero-knowledge instantiations
through innovations in the compiler frameworks used to translate proof
statements to their embeddings in efficient zero-knowledge protocols.

#### *Languages for Differential Privacy* ####

Differential privacy is a promising framework for analyzing data while
providing formal privacy guarantees. Today, implementing
differentially private algorithms is an error-prone process: incorrect
algorithms don't crash; instead, they appear to function correctly,
but don't actually protect privacy. In this project, we invent new
programming languages capable of automatically verifying that an
algorithm satisfies differential privacy, enabling non-experts to
quickly develop correct differentially private algorithms.

#### *Proof Carrying Network Code (PCNC)* ####

The goal of this collaborative project is to support formally well-defined
security guarantees in software defined networks (SDNs) involving multiple
security domains (federations).

*UVM PIs: Chris Skalka. Funded by NSF SaTC award CNS-1718083.*

#### *STRATA* ####

An integrative approach to defense in depth. This multi-institutional research
project seeks to combine authorization, isolation, information flow, and
auditing in a uniform framework. At UVM we are focused on mathematically
well-founded approaches to auditing.
